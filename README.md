# Smart Water Tank IoT Project

The Smart Water Tank IoT project introduces an innovative system designed to revolutionize the monitoring and management of water storage. With the growing concern over water scarcity and resource management, this project aims to address these challenges by implementing an Internet of Things (IoT) framework.

# Features
Real-time Monitoring: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors for accurate measurement of water levels.
Temperature Monitoring: Incorporates DS18B20 temperature sensors for precise water temperature measurements.
Wireless Communication: Transmits data to a centralized platform using Wi-Fi and MQTT protocols.
Comprehensive Analytics: Provides users with actionable insights, including consumption patterns, leak detection, and predictive maintenance.
User-friendly Interface: Access and visualize data through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
